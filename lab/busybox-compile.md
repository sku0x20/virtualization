# BusyBox Compile Lab

Compile BusyBox as a static binary from source — one binary, all tools, no shared libs.

## Goal

Understand how BusyBox bundles hundreds of tools into a single binary and how to build it statically so it works in any minimal root without a dynamic linker.

## TODO

- [ ] Get BusyBox source (busybox.net tarball)
- [ ] Configure — `make defconfig`, then set `CONFIG_STATIC=y`
- [ ] Compile
- [ ] Verify it's statically linked (`file busybox`, `ldd busybox`)
- [ ] Install symlinks (`busybox --install -s /path/to/bin`)
- [ ] Drop into the GPT+GRUB lab in place of the downloaded binary
